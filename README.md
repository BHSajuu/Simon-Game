# Simon Game

This is a simple Simon Game built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The goal of the game is to replicate a sequence of button flashes, which grows in complexity as you progress through levels.

## Features

- Randomly generated color sequences.
- Visual and auditory feedback for each button press.
- Tracks the user's score and highest score.
- Game-over message with the option to restart.

## How to Play

1. Press the "Start" button to begin the game.
2. Watch the pattern of flashing buttons and memorize the sequence.
3. Click on the buttons in the same sequence.
4. As you advance through levels, the sequence gets longer and more challenging.
5. If you make a mistake, the game ends, and your score is displayed.
